Files are indexes based on the project part they were created for.
## Part 1
We have the hits of the original BLAST search, the IDs, the retrieved sequences from Uniref50, the raw and edited alignment, and the model files (HMM and PSSM)
## Part 2
We have the raw files for the model hits, a processed version of the hits in csv format, and the collected ground truth from InterPro
## Part 3
We have a csv with lineages of each member of the family, for each rank shared by all of them, plus a list of the taxa IDs
## Part 4
We have csv files for the enriched terms, with GO id, name, ontology, frequencies in the family and the rest of swissprot, plus raw and adjusted p-values for Fisher's two-tailed exact test. 4_branches.csv contains the top level enriched terms, defined as enriched terms that aren't children of any other one.

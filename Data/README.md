Files are sorted based on project steps:
- 1: create models
- 2: evaluate them

For part 1, there are files for hits for the first Blast search, the raw and edited MSA, and the hmm and pssm generated from the edited alignment.

For part 2, for now there is only the ground truth, with swissprot proteins matching our assigned domain and its position in the protein sequence.

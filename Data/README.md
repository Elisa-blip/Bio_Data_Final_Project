Files are sorted based on project steps:
- 1: create models
- 2: evaluate them

For part 1, there are files for hits for the first Blast search, the raw and edited MSA, and the hmm and pssm generated from the edited alignment.

For part 2, there is the ground truth of proteins matching the Pfam domain (and positions), and the hits returned by the PSSM using PSI-BLAST, together with the alignments

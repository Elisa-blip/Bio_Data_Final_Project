Files are indexes based on the project part they were created for.
## Part 1
We have the hits of the original BLAST search, the IDs, the retrieved sequences from Uniref50, the raw and edited alignment, and the model files (HMM and PSSM)
## Part 2
We have the raw files for the model hits, a processed version of the hits in csv format, and the collected ground truth from InterPro
